Kitchen Craze/Soi Boi is a very very simple video game. It's purpose is to test out the Tamias game engine.

# Running
Use SBCL because I know KC/SB will work with SBCL.

If you don't have it, install quicklisp, link it up with SBCL. Once that's all done then, in the directory where KC/SB is located:

(load "compile.cl") (main)

A window should pop up after a couple of seconds. If any errors come up, make sure you have the sdl2 development libs installed.
